Goal:
A restaurant chain has ordered your company a tool that can detect and answer specific reviews automatically. For this to work, you must build a model that can categorize reviews into "positive" or "negative".

Technologies
Naive Bayes, TextBlob, selecting an appropriate file format (csv, tsv); data cleaning; tokenization, vectorization, lemmatization, stemming, n-grams.

## Contents
The contents of the notebook are as follows:

1. Loading and preprocessing the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset
3. Data preparation for classification and sentiment analysis
4. Classification and Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes and TextBlob
5. Evaluation of the models
6. Conclusion and Future Work

## Dataset Description
The Restaurant Reviews dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and contains reviews of various restaurants. The dataset is used for this project to train and test various NLP techniques.

## Technologies Used
This project uses various NLP techniques such as Naive Bayes, TextBlob, selecting an appropriate file format (csv, tsv), data cleaning, tokenization, vectorization, lemmatization, stemming, and n-grams. These techniques are implemented using Python libraries such as NLTK, TextBlob, and Pandas.

This notebook is suitable for anyone interested in learning about NLP techniques for sentiment analysis and how to apply them to real-world datasets like the Restaurant Reviews dataset.
